## Ant Farms

Editable Fusion files available here
https://a360.co/33jtUHP
Design standards for ant farms based off several designs on Thingiverse such as
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1388709
and https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4188178
These parts are semi-compatiable together. These new ones are just thinner. (so thickness of connectors could be adjusted in a slicer)
These were made to be thinner, use less material, need no 3d printing support. I will post more mods, and hopefully ones with slots for sensors soon!

## Sensors 
Sensors are being developed and tested that can be incorporated into the ant farms, and to the tubing connecting the farms
Code is mostly in arduino, and made for a variety of resources, if you have just LEDs, or photo sensors, or SMD leds that we turn into sensors

Physical Rigs are available here to hold PCBs to clear tubing for the first type of sensor.
